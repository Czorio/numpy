Add ``pad_to_size`` and ``pad_to_match``
----------------------------------------
The new functions ``pad_to_size`` and ``pad_to_match``
are added.
These functions provide some additional functionality
on top of ``pad`` that allow the user to set a target
size instead of having to manually calculate where the
padding needs to happen, provided the target size
is larger than the input array's size in that
dimension.
These functions can handle multiple dimensions

An example call would be::

    >>> input = np.ones((5, 5, 5))
    >>> pad_to_size(input, (10, 10, 10)).shape
    (10, 10, 10)

    >>> target = np.ones((15, 15, 15))
    >>> pad_to_match(input, target).shape
    (15, 15, 15)
